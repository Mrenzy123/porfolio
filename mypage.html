        <h2>About Me...</h2>
        <p>I have completed some of my primary and secondary education level , now with my Diploma certificate. I indulged in activities of maintaining peace and love among people, training speaking skills and leadership skills, saving skills and so on.These were run through clubs.Coding was never my target in my past life because i saw it as very complicating making me have no guts for it .But after indulging in different coding activities ,and as well taking computer-science as my combination, am really committed to coding and enjoy it most times, now grade myself as better.</p>
