        <h2>About Me...</h2>
        <p>I have completed some of my primary and secondary education level , now with my Diploma certificate. I indulged in activities of maintaining peace and love among people, training speaking skills and leadership skills, saving skills and so on.These were run through clubs.Coding was never my target in my past life because i saw it as very complicating making me have no guts for it .But after indulging in different coding activities ,and as well taking computer-science as my combination, am really committed to coding and enjoy it most times, now grade myself as better.</p>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>I am interested in knowing history about things concerning my country.</li>
            <li>I am interested in learning politics, mainly listening to news. </li>
            <li>I am interested in talking to people, sharing ideas with those who match my interests.</li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Besides my interests , there are things i do in daily life my hobbies. I grade them prioritically based on what i do most.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>listening to music. Music holds a big part because i feel more committed to what am doing when am listening to music which is a different thing to others.</li>
            <li>I love drawing, mostly when am free ,i usually like drawing out my thoughts, which trains me to think of more creative things. </li>
